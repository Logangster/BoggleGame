Servers can be so confusing overall. We have run into all sorts of weird exceptions
that we have needed to handle and bugfix, and it has been a long process, but we are finally
getting a good PS8.

Overall the coding process took about 8 hours
Testing took about 2.5 hours to complete
Debugging took about 1 hour to complete
